      <P align=justify>My first experience to the States is more like a story. 
      It jumped in my mind from time to time until I decided to write something 
      about it. 
      <P align=justify>It was August 16, 1995. I was refreshed. After several 
      years of struggle, I was about to realize my dream. To be an outstanding 
      computer engineer, when I was a junior in mathematics I wrote down this in 
      my diary. I never knew exactly what it meant to be `outstanding'. All I 
      knew was that it was not just a title, it meant something substantial. I 
      never realized the trail was so long and uneven for me. I kept climbing 
      and climbing until I forgot what was my first promise. Anyway, it was 
      enviable to go abroad and I was just married. It made me feel great to 
      have my wife see me off at the airport. 
      <P align=justify>The first incident occurred right after I went through 
      the security check. My suitcase was mixed with another passenger's. I was 
      very surprised when I heard my name broadcasted. The two suitcases looked 
      exactly the same, except that mine was heavier. I was uneasy and still 
      thinking about that in my seat, when somebody claimed that I had mistaken 
      his seat. The situation was unfavorable to me. They were three and their 
      seats were adjacent. It was clear that I had to move. But the economy 
      class was full and I was moved to the first class. That's enough, I 
      thought, at least things turned out not too bad at the end. 
      <P align=justify>Something really bad happened after I arrived at JFK. My 
      friend met me at the airport. He had just moved to New York a couple of 
      weeks ago. To the right of the passage at the arrival terminal of 
      Northwestern Airline, there was a small crowd. A gentleman holding a 
      leaflet approached us.<BR>`Need a car?' he asked.<BR>`Yes, he is going to 
      New Jersey.' my friend answered.<BR>`I learned from the university booklet 
      that there is Princeton Airporter Service over here. It is 19 dollars to 
      Newark Airport.' I said.<BR>`Yes, I am from the Princeton Airporter 
      Service.' The gentleman spread the leaflet. It was a price list for the 
      Princeton Airporter Service. `Just follow me, our van is over 
      there.'<BR>We followed him out of the terminal. Outside the terminal 
      another man joined us. This man was stronger, wearing a thick necklace. 
      They spoke with each other quietly for a few seconds, and then led us 
      across the driveway to a van in the parking lot.<BR>`Have you got the 
      key?' the gentleman asked.<BR>`No. We don't need a van. Only one 
      passenger, right? We can drive the car.' The other guy answered.<BR>That 
      sounded reasonable, I thought. We followed them to a black car. My friend 
      hesitated a little.<BR>`Are you sure it is only 19 dollars?' He 
      asked.<BR>`Yes. No problem.' the gentleman said.<BR>My friend talked to me 
      for a while. He told me they might want me to pay for the parking fee, 
      which was 4 dollars. I would stay in my other friend's home in New Jersey 
      for two days, and then move to the residence hall of NJIT.<BR>`Could you 
      please send him directly to this address?' my friend asked, showing them a 
      piece of paper.<BR>`Of course.' they said.<BR>Everything was set. I said 
      goodbye to my friend and entered the car with them. 
      <P align=justify>The strong man drove the car. They paid the parking fee 
      themselves. Once outside the parking lot, the gentleman started to chat 
      with me.<BR>`It's very hot today, isn't it?'<BR>`Yes. I am from Shanghai, 
      China. It was also hot there.'<BR>`Is this the first time you are in the 
      United States?'<BR>`Yes.'<BR>Silent for a while.<BR>`Do you know that the 
      Hamas threatened to bomb JFK today?'<BR>`No. Why they do that in the 
      United States? What do they want?'<BR>`I have no ideas. Maybe they hate 
      the United States government, because it supports anti-terrorism. Most of 
      the public transportation is stopped today.'<BR>A short silence 
      again.<BR>`Do you know it is a long way to New Jersey? It is about 500 
      miles. See, I've got a map here. New York and New Jersey are two states 
      you know.'<BR>I heard something bad.<BR>`But you told my friend it was 
      only 19 dollars, right?'<BR>`Are you kidding?' the strong man 
      joined.<BR>`How much do you want?'<BR>`500 dollars.'<BR>`That's 
      impossible. I've got only 50 dollars in my pocket!' I was angry, `How can 
      you do this to me? You are like the Hamas!'<BR>`What did you say?' the man 
      pulled the car off the road into an empty space and stopped it.<BR>`I said 
      you are like the Hamas. I am sad. This is the first time I am in the 
      United States and I meet you.'<BR>Pausing a little, the strong man talked 
      to the gentleman, `He's got only 50 dollars. We can not take him to New 
      Jersey.'<BR>The gentleman turned to me:`We can take you back to 
      JFK.'<BR>`OK, please take me back to the airport.'<BR>The strong man made 
      a U-turn.<BR>`You are a nice guy. We don't want to charge you for the gas. 
      But you need to pay the parking fee.' the gentleman said.<BR>`OK.' I 
      didn't want to talk any more.<BR>Back to JFK, the gentleman helped me to 
      get a hand-cart, and unload my baggage from the car. I gave him a five 
      dollar bill. `The other dollar is for the gas.' I said, `Thank you 
      anyway.' 
      <P align=justify>Back in the terminal, I found the Ground Transportation 
      and registered for the next bus to Newark Airport. Waiting for the bus, I 
      saw a poster on one side of a pillar. It warned the passengers not to take 
      any cars without a taxi sign. They could be swindlers. When I looked at 
      the two men in the picture, one of them looked just like the strong man 
      except that in the picture he wore a hat. 
      <P align=justify>It was evening when I arrived at Newark Airport. I was 
      frightened of even taxis. I called my friend. She and her husband came to 
      pick me up at the airport. They had called New Jersey Institute of 
      Technology and the administrator allowed me to check in at the Cypress 
      Hall right away. 
      <P align=justify>Later, when I told one of my roommates about this, he 
      said I should have memorized their plate number and called the policeman. 
      I don't think I will do that even today. I did not want any more troubles 
      as long as I could get rid of them. Besides, to me they were civilized 
      swindlers. What if they had taken me somewhere else instead of bringing me 
      back to JFK? When I told this to my English professor, she said I should 
      told my story to the Office for International Students and Faculty. I did 
      not do that either. But I decide to put it here. If you are going to the 
      States and you happen to read this, it may help you in some way. Remember, 
      you need to register for the Princeton Airporter Service at the Ground 
      Transportation. When the bus comes, the driver will get the passengers 
      from the Ground Transportation. I believe other airports also have similar 
      arrangement.</P>
