<H3>ON HERO</H3></CENTER>
      <P align=justify>What is a hero? Does a hero need to be a great person? 
      Does he or she have to do something really big? In my opinion, a hero is 
      someone who has strong faith in the kindness and good conduct of people. A 
      hero should be able to face all possible difficulties in his life, to 
      challenge the unfortunate with courage, to keep doing good things no 
      matter how hard the environment is. When talking about hero, I can not 
      help thinking of my father. 
      <P align=justify>My father is a modest plain person, who managed to go 
      through twenty years of misfortune bravely. In his early 30's, My father 
      joined the executive staff of Dongshan County, which is a beautiful 
      peninsula locating at the sea shore of southern China. He was very 
      promising for his kindness, integrity, and intelligence. Just at that 
      time, some person declared that my father was once a member of an 
      anti-Communist organization. Though no evidence was found, he was 
      dismissed from the staff and treated as a counterrevolutionary guy. It was 
      assumed that all evidence had been destroyed or transferred to Taiwan. The 
      truth was that that person was once a principal of the high school where 
      my father was a student. My father did so well in his classes that he was 
      free of tuition and fees, and the principal knew him by name. It turned 
      out that the principal was a group leader of some anti-Communist 
      organization. Some people tortured him to name all the members of his 
      group and he was forced to lie. 
      <P align=justify>During the so called Cultural Revolution period, my 
      father was tortured several times by the Red Guard Army. They hanged a 
      huge board around his neck, forced him to stand on a high platform to show 
      to the crowd, and sometimes led him to parade through the street. My 
      father never admitted what was not true to him. He kept writing letters to 
      the authorities to explain what was the truth. After numerous failures, he 
      was forced to live among the peasants in the countryside far from our 
      home-town. It was a beautiful small village surrounded by mountains. 
      Nevertheless, life was very hard over there. My father had to plant rice, 
      sweet potato, and vegetables for his own consumption. He worked hard and 
      earned little. There was no transportation to the village. People had to 
      climb across some small hills by feet to get there. Fortunately, the 
      peasants of the poor village were very kind to him. They let him live with 
      them in their houses without rents. 
      <P align=justify>My father tried to help the people there. He studied 
      diseases and medicines from books and professional doctors in our 
      home-town and offered free medical care to the people. The villagers used 
      to take Chinese herbs as medicine. My father studied many kinds of herbs. 
      This may sound not scientific enough. However, since many peasants were 
      illiterate at that time, it made sense to help them to learn more about 
      what they were taking as medicine. 
      <P align=justify>One other thing my father learned to help the villagers 
      was mending china. Chinese people used various types of china as 
      containers. These containers were made of earth and burnt hard in high 
      temperature ovens. The villagers there used huge china containers to store 
      fresh water, rice, and many other things. Those containers were heavy but 
      fragile. Once they were broken, they could not be used any more. As the 
      village was far from the road, transportation was difficult. The people 
      there had to carry the new containers by their shoulders as soon as they 
      left the road. It would be very helpful if the broken containers could be 
      reused by mending. To mend the broken containers, my father learned a 
      practical skill from someone else. First of all, he collected some metal 
      powder from a factory and mixed it with salted water. Then he knocked the 
      edge of the gap in the container with a chisel to expose the new surface 
      and applied the mixture to the opening. After several days, the metal 
      powder became rusted and it held the gap tightly. This worked very well 
      and the people were happy with the result. From then on, my father was 
      often requested to mend broken containers for the peasants in the nearby 
      villages. 
      <P align=justify>My father also learned to play music instruments such as 
      flute and erhu in his leisure time. Sometimes he played Chinese chess with others. 
      It seemed to me that he always believed that one day he would win back his 
      dignity. 
      <P align=justify>My father kept telling us to be kind with other children, 
      to be respectful to the elders, to be cooperative with the teachers, to be 
      diligent in our studies. Any little progress we had made would make him 
      happy. When I was a teenage, I lived with my mother in our home-town where 
      I got my primary and high school education. I often went to the village to 
      live with my father during my summer vacations. The villagers were very 
      kind to us. I learned much from my father, his courage to face 
      difficulties, his spirit to help others, his intelligence in solving 
      problems. Though life was more difficult there than that in our home-town, 
      I was happy to be with my father. 
      <P align=justify>In 1981, while I was a senior in Xiamen University, my 
      father was liberated by Mr. Deng Xiaoping. He was told to retire from the 
      position he occupied some twenty years ago. That meant the whole thing 
      charged upon him was a mistake and he could now get pension from the 
      government. 
      <P align=justify>The more than twenty years' sad story was ended. But life 
      was not much easier for my father. My mother was also tortured during the 
      Cultural Revolution period. She was checked out to have high blood 
      pressure and heart disease. She also retired at about the same time as my 
      father. She was so weak that she could not do any heavy chores. She went 
      to hospital frequently and took medicine every day. I am proud of 
      my mother too. She was once demanded to choose between divorce and 
      dismissal when my father was fired. She stood firm for twenty months and 
      was called back to work for her being a daughter of a poor family. She 
      worked faithfully to provide our living and educational expenses. She was 
      then too exhausted to work any more. Even a long walk could make her out of 
      breath. Yet, with the help of my father, she never gave up her struggle. 
      In my deep memory, there is an unforgettable scene. It was in June 1990. I 
      came back from Shanghai to visit my mother who was hospitalized. She was 
      happy and wanted to go home with me. Before leaving the hospital, she 
      combed her hair and tidied up her clothes very carefully with her shaking 
      hands. I was touched. That was my mother. Though so weak in body, she was 
      so strong in spirit. My mother passed away in July 1990 in a sudden heart 
      attack. Those days were emotionally harder for my father as well as for us 
      -- their beloved children. 
      <P align=justify>My father is now seventy years old and living with my 
      grandmother, who is ninety one years old. He wants to take care of her. I 
      regret to have no much time to be with him since I entered university. 
      `Never mind, son' My father would say: `Your mother was always proud of 
      you for being able to fly so far and so high. We are all proud of you.' I 
      am proud of my father. He is always a hero in my mind.</P></br>
